* Object Analysis: Simply place the device in front of an object and Vysual Assyst will classify it using computer vision. (Ex: Water Bottle, Computer, Book)
* Scene Analysis: Simply place the device in the vicinity of a scene and Vysual Assyst will classify the user's current location using computer vision. (Ex: Bedroom, Office, Park)
* Distance Detection: Using augmented reality technology, Vysual Assyst continuously determines the distance from the device to the closest object.
* Distance Warning: Once an object comes within one foot of the device, Vysual Assyst will begin to deliver haptic feedback and/or an alert sound.
